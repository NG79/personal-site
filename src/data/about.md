# Intro

I am a technology enthusiast and experienced business-technology leader who has spent 2 decades building solutions for B2B clients. I have served banking, healthcare, lifesciences and CPG clients. My clients and co-workers love my collaborative style of leadership, passion for learning and figuring things out, speaking up with honesty, and being hands-on.

# Currently

I am looking for opportunities to build solutions with other curious minds in outstanding organizations.

# I love

- The feeling of "wow" when I find little rabbit holes of interest, dive deep into it obsessively, and come out of it with a completely new perspective

- Going on long walks that help me think through things

- Connecting the dots (people / ideas / disciplines)

- Landscape paintings (Youtube has been an amazing tutor for me as a hobby painter)

- Watching astronomy shows with Neil deGrasse Tyson (Current fave being 'Cosmos - Possible Worlds')

- Listening to Music (Blues, Jazz, Indian Classical, Heavy Metal) and Podcasts

- Reading non-fiction books

- Being a parent, observing and (re-)learning from/through/with children

- Crafting and building odds and ends

# Some history

- I was born in Bangalore in the late 70's. When I was a child, I thought news readers actually knew everything. I wanted to be a news reader - until I realized they were only reading scripts.

- My first job was designing electronics with GPS chips, and was fascinating. But, the software bug bit me and there's been no looking back.

- I remember being told in my first interview in 2000 that I was being hired for my "learnability". That trait has served me well for 20+ years and I believe it always will.

- When I pursued my MBA, I really did it for the learning, because I felt "stuck" in my job and I thought would help me figure out what I wanted to be. I had no game plan, and was frankly worried that I didn't (everyone else seemed so sure!). When I got a business development role post my MBA, I took it on to challenge myself even though I hadn't really imagined myself as a "selling" type of person. It was hard(for me), but I also learnt a lot about myself during those 5-6 years.

- However, there's something about thinking through hard problems, experimenting, creating solutions and getting real user feedback that excites me more than selling solutions, though I can understand both perspectives. And without sales, there isn't much to build in a sustained way, anyway. As a builder, I can see a sales person's perspective better now.

- During my maternity leave, I tried to learn R while also trying to be a mom for the first time. I highly regret doing that now :)

- I have mostly played business roles over the past 10 years, but just for fun, I continued to work on my hands-on coding skills on the side. I learnt Python, Celonis for Process Mining, Tableau for data visualization, React, Javascript and now have begun Blockchain. Most of these were not really expected of me on the job front, but knowing each skill has given me super powers in my business roles.

- I love coding for fun, but its not something I want to do all the time for a living. Coding keeps me honest. Coding helps me think better, experiement with fun things to build (like this website), and communicate and collaborate better.

- There's no role I enjoy more than being a mom.
