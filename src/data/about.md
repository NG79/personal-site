# Intro

I am an enthusiastic business-technology leader who has spent 2 decades building solutions for B2B clients. I have served banking, healthcare, lifesciences and CPG clients. My clients and co-workers love my collaborative style of leadership, passion for learning and figuring things out, speaking up with honesty, and being hands-on.

# Currently

I am looking for opportunities to build solutions with other curious minds in outstanding organizations.

# I love

- Helping business and technology teams collaborate with each other to build awesome things

- The feeling of "wow" when I find little rabbit holes of interest, dive deep into it obsessively, and come out of it with a completely new perspective

- Going on long walks that help me think through things

- Connecting the dots (people / ideas / disciplines)

- Being a parent, observing and (re-)learning from/through/with children

- Watching astronomy shows (Current fave being 'Cosmos - Possible Worlds' with Neil deGrasse Tyson)

- Listening to Music (Blues, Jazz, Indian Classical, Heavy Metal) and Podcasts

- Coding for fun. Coding keeps me honest. Coding helps me think better, harness my creative spirit, communicate and collaborate better.

- Reading non-fiction books

- Landscape paintings (Youtube has been an AMAZING tutor for me as a hobby painter)

# Some history

- I was born in Bangalore in the late 70's. When I was a child, I thought news readers actually knew everything. I wanted to be a news reader - until I realized they were only reading scripts.

- My first job was designing electronics with GPS chips, and was fascinating. But, the software bug bit me and there's been no looking back.

- I remember being told in my first interview in 2000 that I was being hired for my "learnability". That trait has served me well for 20+ years and I believe it always will.

- During my maternity leave, I tried to learn R while also trying to be a mom for the first time. Slotted under #what-was-i-thinking!? :)

- I have loved played business roles over the past 10 years, and will likely continue to do so, but just for fun, I kept working on my hands-on coding skills on the side. I learnt Python, Celonis for Process Mining, Tableau for data visualization, React, Javascript and now have begun Blockchain. Most of these were not expected of me on the job front, but knowing each skill has given me super powers in my business roles.
