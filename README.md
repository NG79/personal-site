# Personal Website

This repo was adapted from mldangelo's repo (https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site). 

Changes made by me:
Replaced statistics with Blog, powered by CMS.
Modidied projects section to have two types of projects
Minor modifications to other pages

## Dependencies

Tested with: [node](https://nodejs.org/) >= v12 and optional [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for managing node versions.

Added in this adaptation: CMS using Sanity.IO. Follow latest instructions from https://www.sanity.io/guides/build-your-first-blog-using-react to integrate cms into React. 

Please reach out if you run into issues. I owe many thanks to mldangelo and am happy to pay it forward to anyone who is starting out like me. 

For detailed React set-up, I recommend looking up mldangelo's notes.
